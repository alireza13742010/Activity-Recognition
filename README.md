# Activity-Recognition
Activity Recognition is defined as part of the image classification techniques that can be used to detect abnormal and normal behaviours.

In this repository transfer learning model is used to train the model. The evaluated models envovles:
1. ResNet50
2. ResNet152
3. DenseNet169
4. EfficientNetV2S
Based on the evaluated results the base backbone model for feature extraction is EfficientNetV2S.

The detection classes are: calling, clapping, cycling, dancing, drinking, eating,
                           fighting, hugging, laughing, listening_to_music, running,
                           sitting, sleeping, texting, and using_laptop.
